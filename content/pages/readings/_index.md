## Other Sources of General Course Material

- [*Wired* Magazine](http://www.wired.com/wired/) displays the Gucci look for cyberspace (and Hal wrote this **before** they were purchased by Cond√©-Nast), with almost as many fonts per issue as the MIT Admissions Office's publicity booklet. You'll have to dig up more serious material for the course, but *Wired* is OK for general reading and there are occasional excellent articles.
- [The Electronic Frontier Foundation](http://www.eff.org/) maintains extensive on-line [archives](http://www.eff.org/). These will be useful throughout the semester, especially the collections on [Legislation](https://www.eff.org/timeline-category/legislation) and [Legal](https://www.eff.org/work) issues, and the [Privacy, Security, Crypto, and Surveillance Archive](https://www.eff.org/issues/privacy). You should also check out current and past issues of their newsletter, the [EFFector](http://www.eff.org/effector/).
- The [Center for Democracy and Technology](http://www.cdt.org/) is an organization concerned with civil liberties in computer and communications technologies. Their home page is a good place to look for information on current legislative action.
- The [Electronic Privacy Information Center](http://www.epic.org/) is a public-interest group that deals with civil liberty issues relating to the National Information Infrastructure. It is also the Washington Office of Privacy International. There are good on-line collections on [computer security](http://www.epic.org/security/), [privacy](http://www.epic.org/privacy/), [cryptography policy](http://www.epic.org/crypto/), and [free speech](http://www.epic.org/free_speech/).
- Lexis/Nexis: Law review articles, court rulings, and many other resources can be found in [Lexis-Nexis Universe](http://www.lexisnexis.com/sg/nanyangpoly/index.html). Subscriptions to Lexis/Nexis are licensed by institutions and are restricted. The links to Lexis/Nexis resources in this archive work at MIT only -- they can be accessed only from within the MIT network. Other people who wish to get hold of the Lexis/Nexis material cited in this archive will need to arrange for their own access.
- The U.S. Congress public information system provides keyword searches of the [Congressional Record](https://www.congress.gov/).
- Here are two classic science-fiction works that don't have anything to do with the course directly -- or maybe they have everything to do with the course directly, since they describe the futures we may be laying the groundwork for with today's network technology. Food for thought:
    - Gibson, William. *Neuromancer*. From the man who invented the word "cyberspace." If you've read the book and liked it, you may want to look at the sequels, *Count Zero* and *Mona Lisa Overdrive*.
    - Vinge, Vernor. "True Names." in the collection *True Names and other Dangers*. Written in the early 80s, this short story is frighteningly prophetic of current issues having to do with anonymity, privacy, and security on the network.
