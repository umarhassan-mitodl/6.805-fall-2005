## Other Sources of General Course Material

- {{% resource_link "941e3bf8-e5a8-4dee-8ea6-b8de25e5c0b2" "*Wired* Magazine" %}} displays the Gucci look for cyberspace (and Hal wrote this **before** they were purchased by Cond√©-Nast), with almost as many fonts per issue as the MIT Admissions Office's publicity booklet. You'll have to dig up more serious material for the course, but *Wired* is OK for general reading and there are occasional excellent articles.
- {{% resource_link "633f32db-9a1e-461a-9ca6-cce9a745f268" "The Electronic Frontier Foundation" %}} maintains extensive on-line {{% resource_link "633f32db-9a1e-461a-9ca6-cce9a745f268" "archives" %}}. These will be useful throughout the semester, especially the collections on {{% resource_link "fbe40e88-d1fb-4ef7-b95a-e17d29f83faf" "Legislation" %}} and {{% resource_link "629d3838-5375-4af5-b55c-4047d3aff253" "Legal" %}} issues, and the {{% resource_link "50821d52-5f47-4783-857e-c66f638f8529" "Privacy, Security, Crypto, and Surveillance Archive" %}}. You should also check out current and past issues of their newsletter, the {{% resource_link "956c8510-4ef9-4d05-b475-63989efdd925" "EFFector" %}}.
- The {{% resource_link "feae4b04-c1b3-49a0-b22b-cd68f00efecd" "Center for Democracy and Technology" %}} is an organization concerned with civil liberties in computer and communications technologies. Their home page is a good place to look for information on current legislative action.
- The {{% resource_link "c43b17d3-e79e-499d-91a9-a4cc95ca3f35" "Electronic Privacy Information Center" %}} is a public-interest group that deals with civil liberty issues relating to the National Information Infrastructure. It is also the Washington Office of Privacy International. There are good on-line collections on {{% resource_link "c5554eaf-61cb-488a-bd6f-f50e00246f27" "computer security" %}}, {{% resource_link "ec78af15-4f62-48a4-baad-0fe1139f9efa" "privacy" %}}, {{% resource_link "338cebff-c22e-44d8-bf69-8b354e59d4da" "cryptography policy" %}}, and {{% resource_link "d1e703bd-4057-4741-a750-9e5841b80978" "free speech" %}}.

Subscriptions to Lexis/Nexis are licensed by institutions and are restricted. The links to Lexis/Nexis resources in this archive work at MIT only -- they can be accessed only from within the MIT network. Other people who wish to get hold of the Lexis/Nexis material cited in this archive will need to arrange for their own access.
- The U.S. Congress public information system provides keyword searches of the {{% resource_link "7e205ba0-585f-485f-bfba-07f443002699" "Congressional Record" %}}.
- Here are two classic science-fiction works that don't have anything to do with the course directly -- or maybe they have everything to do with the course directly, since they describe the futures we may be laying the groundwork for with today's network technology. Food for thought:
    - Gibson, William. *Neuromancer*. From the man who invented the word "cyberspace." If you've read the book and liked it, you may want to look at the sequels, *Count Zero* and *Mona Lisa Overdrive*.
    - Vinge, Vernor. "True Names." in the collection *True Names and other Dangers*. Written in the early 80s, this short story is frighteningly prophetic of current issues having to do with anonymity, privacy, and security on the network.
