There was a tremendous amount published during 1994 on the Escrowed Encryption Standard (Clipper) and U.S. export controls on cryptography. Here are some items culled from the Net, in chronological order. Even looking through the titles of this chronology gives an overview of the interplay between politics, publicity, and technical argument in U.S. policy making. Remember that the Clipper debate is intertwined with debate over U.S. export control (the failed Cantwell Amendment) and the Digital Telephony bill. The articles here show the evolution of the Clipper controversy during 1994.
